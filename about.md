Hey, I'm Alex, and right now I study computer science at Brown University. When I'm not tinkering with code, you might find me singing, learning new languages, working behind-the-scenes in theater, teaching others to program, or exploring the environments around me. My best work often comes at the intersection of my many interests, and I'm excited to get out into the world and make awesome things!

For now, feel free to check out the rest of this website to see some [things I've written](posts.html) or [things I've made](projects.html).
