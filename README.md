:warning: This repository contains the old version of my personal website, powered by Jekyll, which I used from 2016 until mid-2025. I overhauled the site several times during that period, most recently in October 2024.

You can find the new version of my site, which uses Next.js, at [amazansky/alexmazansky.com](https://github.com/amazansky/alexmazansky.com).

## Setup

`bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --config _config_dev.yml,_config.yml`
